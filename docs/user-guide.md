## Managing Callings

### Calling Status Workflow

Callings move through these statuses:

1. **Pending**: Initial proposal, awaiting approval
2. **Stake Presidency Approved**: Approved by stake presidency, may need high council approval
3. **High Council Approved**: Approved by high council (for applicable positions)
4. **Called**: Calling has been extended and accepted by member
5. **LCR Updated**: Information has been updated in LCR system
6. **On Hold**: Temporarily paused for various reasons

### Approval Workflow
```
PENDING → APPROVED (Stake Presidency) → HC_APPROVED (High Council) → CALLED → LCR_UPDATED
                                        ↓
                                    ON_HOLD (temporary pause)
```

**Note**: Not all callings require High Council approval. Some positions can go directly from Stake Presidency Approved to Called.
